# üß† Parkinson's Early Detection Model

An AI-powered, multimodal early detection system for Parkinson's Disease using voice analysis, eye-blink rate from video, and patient age. This project leverages computer vision, signal processing, and machine learning to assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis of Parkinson‚Äôs.

## üöÄ Features

- üéôÔ∏è **Voice Analysis:** Uses jitter and shimmer from audio recordings.
- üëÅÔ∏è **Blink Rate Estimation:** Detects and counts eye blinks from webcam input.
- üéÇ **Age Prediction:** Uses age as a demographic indicator.
- üß© **Multimodal Fusion:** Combines all three modalities using weighted probabilities.
- üíª **Web Dashboard:** Upload media, get instant results, and view reports.

## üß† Model Weights

The repository includes pre-trained models stored in the `/models` directory. These models were trained on extracted features from curated datasets of Parkinson‚Äôs and healthy patients.

- `audio_model.pkl`: Trained on jitter/shimmer features
- `blink_model.pkl`: Trained on blink rate per minute
- `age_model.pkl`: Logistic regression based on age

## üìà Example Input & Output

**Input:**
- 10-second webcam video
- User's age

**Output:**
```json
{
  "Name":"Alex",
  "Fused Probability": 0.7002,
  "Prediction":"Parkinson's Detected",
  "Blink Rate": "23 Blinks/min",
  "Audio Probability": 0.6350,
  "Age & Blink Probability": 0.4472
}
```
